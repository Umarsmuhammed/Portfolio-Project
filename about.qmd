My Name is Umar Sani Muhammad I have a strong academic background in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer science which are essentials for data science, I have Bsc Mathematics and just of recent I finished my Msc in Computational Mathematics from Bayero University Kano. I was lucky to be part of first cohort of Arewa Data Science Academy in which we were trained on Python programming and Machine learning.
